# C#-Store-RPG-Assignment
AIE Assignment for C#

## Description:
This assesment is to create a text-based store which shows the foundation of data structures and file reading in C#.

The game is a simple text-based store trader which allows the player to purchase items from the shops inventory and add them to their own. From there the player can then sell it back to the store.

## How to compile:
To compile the files, open the solution file (.sln) in visual studio and press F7.

## How to run the game:
To run the game open the .exe file. Two text files will also be created in the same location (i recommend putting the .exe in a folder).
